## Away Mission Manager Application

**To *boldly* where no one has gone before...**

You are a starship captain on the USS Intrepid (NCC-74600) in the late 24th century.

This application will be used by the starship captain (who definitely should not be on away missions) to create new
away teams for missions and manage the away team from the safety of the ship.

This application will fill the current need of the starship captain to feel involved in the away mission while still
following Starfleet Regulation Section 12, Paragraph 4.

//TODO ask if if need more here

As a user, I want to be able to:
- create a new away mission
- end an away mission and add it to the mission log
- assign crew members (X) to away missions (Y)
- select a crew member and get stats on the crew member, for example, rank and division
- check status of away mission, for example, is the mission active
- emergency beam out the away team
