## Away Mission Manager Application

**To *boldly* where no one has gone before...**

You are a starship captain on the USS Intrepid (NCC-74600) in the late 24th century.

This application will be used by the starship captain (who definitely should not be on away missions) to create new
away teams for missions and manage the away team from the safety of the ship.

This application will fill the current need of the starship captain to feel involved in the away mission while still
following Starfleet Regulation Section 12, Paragraph 4.

### User Stories

As the Captain, I want to be able to:
- create a new away mission
- end an away mission
- view previous missions in the mission log
- assign crew members (X) to away mission (Y)
- remove crew members from the away mission team
- select a crew member and get stats on the crew member, for example, rank and division
- emergency beam out the away team 
- have the option to the current starship data when I select the quit option from the application menu 
- have the option to the previous starship data when I start the application
