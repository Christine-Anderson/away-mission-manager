## Away Mission Manager Applicaton

**To *boldly* where no one has gone before...**

You are a starship captain on the USS Intrepid (NCC-74600) in the late 24th century.

This application will be used by the starship captain (who definitely should not be on away missions) to create new away teams for missions and manage the away team from the safety of the ship.

This application will fill the current need of the starship captain to feel involved in the away mission while still following Starfleet Regulation Section 12, Paragraph 4.
